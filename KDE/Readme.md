## KDE is awesome!

Here are some things where I try to help KDE a bit.

### ServiceMenus
If you know the syntax, you can create lots of useful right-click actions for Dolphin.

Just download a service-menu (.desktop) to the folder (~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus) and it will work!

These can be any commands that work with Files. Especially Flatpak extensions are missing.

### Appstarters

You can execute any Command using the start menu, this makes a lot easier and beginner-friendlier.

### SDDM-Themes
There are awesome presets online.

Problem is, that OStree based Distros like Fedora Kinoite or OpenSuse microOS block users from changing the /usr/ path completely, where also the themes are at.
So using the nice tool "sddm2rpm" you can convert normal SDDM themes to RPM-packages that are then installable.

I have some presets available for ease of use.
