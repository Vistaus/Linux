## Waydroid

This is not an emulator. Like Distrobox or other Linux distros, you can run Android as a container. The kernel stays your native one, but all the libraries match to the OS.

This means you can run lots of Android apps on your Linux Laptop, increasing its usability a lot.

## Setup

1. [Install waydroid from your Distro](https://docs.waydro.id/usage/install-on-desktops)

2. Setup Appstarters and Tools

3.
